# Important Cleanup TODOs

- Item Components and the Simple(Block)MetaItem system
  - This system seems to be more or less redundant now. Either rewrite them to make more sense, or just get rid of 'em.
- Standardize and cleanup translations.

# Bugs
 - Rendering just doesn't?
 - Pedestals run pickup logic when the internal item stack is empty.
 - The entirety of the arcane workbench menu.
# Notes

- The Forge OBJ loader is weird. When using blockbench, UVs are flipped verticially and offset by .5 on the X and Z axis.
